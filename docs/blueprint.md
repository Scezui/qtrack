# **App Name**: QTrack

## Core Features:

- QR Code Generation: Generate QR codes from user profile data using an AI tool.
- User List: Display a sortable list of registered users with their QR codes. (Without database)
- Camera Access for Scanning: Allow the app to use the camera for scanning QR codes. Since it's a QR attendance app, there is no login and logout functionality, only the first time the QR code gets scanned, the user is registered
- Record log: Record who is on or is not on for a specific day by exporting the list.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Use a vibrant blue (#29ABE2) to represent trust and technology, as the focus should be more on usability than personality.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F2F5), very desaturated but visibly the same hue as the primary, to ensure legibility and reduce eye strain.
- Accent color: A complementary green (#90EE90) to highlight successful scans or confirmations.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', sans-serif, for a clear, modern, and readable appearance.
- Use a consistent style of simple, outlined icons throughout the app.
- Use a clean, intuitive layout that prioritizes easy navigation and clear presentation of information.
- Subtle animations when the QR code is scanned
